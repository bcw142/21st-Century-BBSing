# 21st-Century-BBSing
Using Bulletin Board Systems in the 21 century.
Created this repository to explorer BBS use in the 21 century. They first existed in the 1980's and have continued to today, most now via telnet (telnet to bcw142.zapto.org URL telnet://bcw142.zapto.org to see my Mystic Pi BBS). They were a pre-web way of socializing. Mine also has a simple static web setup at the same address (http://bcw142.zapto.org). My BBS is part of FSXNet and RetroNet at the moment. They are EchoMail/File networks of BBS https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bulletin_board_system.
Not sure yet what markup language is used here, but I know typing an address links it. Let's see how it deals with normal HTML:
<BR><A HREF=http://telnetbbsguide.com/>Telnet BBS Guide</A> |
<A HREF=http://telnetbbsguide.com/bbs/list/brief>Brief Telnet BBS List</A> |
<A HREF=http://telnetbbsguide.com/bbs/list/detail>Detailed Telnet BBS List</A> | 
<A HREF=http://syncterm.bbsdev.net/>SyncTERM</A> for various systems |
<BR>Looks normal to me so I guess I can use it ;)<BR>
Just a quick file of links to other related GitHub repositories:<BR>

<BR>Looks like .md files will work as HTML, but .html won't!
